@article{egan2007,
	Abstract = {I think that there are good reasons to adopt a relativist semantics for epistemic modal claims such as "the treasure might be under the palm tree", according to which such utterances determine a truth value relative to something finer-grained than just a world (or a <world, time> pair). Anyone who is inclined to relativise truth to more than just worlds and times faces a problem about assertion. It's easy to be puzzled about just what purpose would be served by assertions of this kind, and how to understand what we'd be up to in our use of sentences like "the treasure might be under the palm tree", if they have such peculiar truth conditions. After providing a very quick argument to motivate a relativist view of epistemic modals, I bring out and attempt to resolve this problem in making sense of the role of assertions with relativist truth conditions. Solving this problem should be helpful in two ways: first, it eliminates an apparently forceful objection to relativism, and second, spelling out the relativist account of assertion and communication will help to make clear just what the relativist position is, exactly, and why it's interesting.},

	Abstract = {The desire to minimize the number of individual new entities postulated is often referred to as quantitative parsimony. Its influence on the default hypotheses formulated by scientists seems undeniable. I argue that there is a wide class of cases for which the preference for quantitatively parsimonious hypotheses is demonstrably rational. The justification, in a nutshell, is that such hypotheses have greater explanatory power than less parsimonious alternatives. My analysis is restricted to a class of cases I shall refer to as additive. Such cases involve the postulation of a collection of qualitatively identical individual objects which collectively explain some particular observed phenomenon. Especially clear examples of this sort occur in particle physics.1 Introduction2 Particle physics: a case study3 Three kinds of simplicity4 Explanatory power5 Explanation and non‐observation6 Parsimony and scientific methodology7 Conclusions},

In order to motivate this view, I consider two cases from the history of science: the postulation of the neutrino and the proposal of Avogadro's hypothesis. I also consider two issues concerning how a principle of quantitative parsimony should be framed.},

@incollection{price2004,
	Abstract = {Wittgenstein is often thought to have challenged the view that assertion is an important theoretical category in a philosophical view of language. One of Wittgenstein\textquoteright{}s main themes in the early sections of the Investigations is that philosophy misses important distinctions about the uses of language, distinctions hidden from us by \textquoteleft{}the uniform appearances of words.\textquoteright (1968, \#11) As Wittgenstein goes on to say: It is like looking into the cabin of a locomotive. We see handles all looking more or less alike. (Naturally, since they are all supposed to be handled.) But one is the handle of a crank which can be moved continuously (it regulates the opening of a valve); another is the handle of a switch, which has only two effective positions, it is either off or on; a third is the handle of a brake-lever, the harder one pulls on it, the harder it brakes; a fourth, the handle of a pump: it has an effect only so long as it is moved to and fro. (1968, \#12) Few contemporary philosophers share Wittgenstein\textquoteright{}s evident familiarity with cabin of a steam locomotive, and in general, most of us are increasingly remote from all but the most superficial understanding of the underlying functions of the tools on which we rely. So we are perhaps even more prone to the mistake that Wittgenstein thinks that philosophy makes with respect to language, that of regarding it as one tool rather than many: \textquoteleft{}Think of the tools in a tool-box: there is a hammer, pliers, a saw, a screw-driver, a rule, a glue-pot, glue, nails and screws.---{}The functions of words are as diverse as the functions of these objects.\textquoteright{}1 (1968, \#11)},

	Abstract = {Recent philosophy of language has been profoundly impacted by the idea that mainstream, model-theoretic semantics is somehow incompatible with deflationary accounts of truth and reference. The present article systematizes the case for incompatibilism, debunks circularity and  '' modal confusion'' arguments familiar in the literature, and reconstructs the popular thought that truth-conditional semantics somehow  '' presupposes'' a correspondence theory of truth as an inference to the best explanation. The case for compatibilism is closed by showing that this {IBE} argument fails to rule out two kinds of deflationism: the position Field famously accused Tarski of having; and a less familiar version of the view that defines reference in terms of a deflated notion of truth. Finally, the distinction between unifying and constitutive explanation is used to forestall the response that correspondence theory is literally part of mainstream semantics.},

@article{yalcin2012,
	Abstract = {I develop a conception of expressivism according to which it is chiefly a pragmatic thesis about some fragment of discourse, one imposing certain constraints on semantics. The first half of the paper uses credal expressivism about the language of probability as a stalking-horse for this purpose. The second half turns to the question of how one might frame an analogous form of expressivism about the language of deontic modality. Here I offer a preliminary comparison of two expressivist lines. The first, expectation expressivism, looks again to Bayesian modelling for inspiration: it glosses deontically modal language as characteristically serving to express decision-theoretic expectation (expected utility). The second, plan expressivism, develops the idea (due to Gibbard 2003) that this language serves to express 'plan-laden' states of belief. In the process of comparing the views, I show how to incorporate Gibbard's modelling ideas into a compositional semantics for attitudes and modals, filling a lacuna in the account. I close with the question whether and how plan expressivism might be developed with expectation-like structure.},

@book{blackburn1993,
	Abstract = {This volume collects some influential essays in which Simon Blackburn, one of our leading philosophers, explores one of the most profound and fertile of philosophical problems: the way in which our judgments relate to the world. This debate has centered on realism, or the view that what we say is validated by the way things stand in the world, and a variety of oppositions to it. Prominent among the latter are expressive and projective theories, but also a relaxed pluralism that discourages the view that there are substantial issues at stake. The figure of the "quasi-realist" dramatizes the difficulty of conducting these debates. Typically philosophers thinking of themselves as realists will believe that they alone can give a proper or literal account of some of our attachments--to truth, to facts, to the independent world, to knowledge and certainty. The quasi-realist challenge, developed by Blackburn in this volume, is that we can have those attachments without any metaphysic that deserves to be called realism, so that the metaphysical picture that goes with our practices is quite idle. The cases treated here include the theories of value and knowledge, modality, probability, causation, intentionality and rule-following, and explanation. A substantial new introduction has been added, drawing together some of the central themes. The essays articulate a fresh alternative to a primitive realist/anti-realist opposition, and their cumulative effect is to yield a new appreciation of the delicacy of the debate in these central areas.},

@article{horwich2007,
	Annote = {He first goes on to make the suggestion that we may as well need some criterion for determining whether a sentence (say) is robustly true. The different candidates haven't been discarded, but until one finds reason for believing one and not the others, one may be tempted by quietism. (Why?) He then goes on to discuss Fine's proposal. 

The main three tenets of Fine's theory are formulated as follows: 

(i) A constitutively basic (i.e. ungrounded) proposition is factual only if all of its components are factual. 
(ii) Propositions specifying the referents of terms are likely to be factual.
(iii) Any unanalyzable, factual, essential component of a proposition must recur somewhere in the constituting grounds (if any) of that proposition. 

(Recall that, for fine, a proposition contains a constituent essentially if its replacemebt by other constituent can induce a change in truth value.)


Horwich has qualms over both (iii) an (ii). 

For (ii), all he does is bring up Krikenstein. (The antifactualist will not be worried if facts about f-ness end up in the grounding of the practice of using fs, since those grounds themselves would not be factual.) 

For (iii) he comes up with some more clever counterexamples. An example is provided by use theories of meaning. If what ultimately grounds our meaning what we do by `quarks' involves only certain facts about usage, would this mean that statements about quarks aren't factual? (This is, of course, what Fine would say, though Horwich objects: "such a response would reveal a commitment to a previously unacknowledged criterion of FACTUALITY: --- namely, `f-ness is FACTUAL if and only if word w's reference to it is grounded in w's relation to f'. This is somewhat mysterious to me, in that it doesn't seem to be "unacknowledged". Horwich claims that it isn't "neutral": what does that mean? See p. 5-6 for discussion.)

Horwich thinks, regardless, that this problem with Fine's account is not surprising, for he has "general considerations" that suggest that there is a problem in using these notions: that theories providing the content of notions like "robust" and "factual" are maintained only on the basis of irrational elements. 

1) It has been thought that the right account of meaning will imply that some sentences are meaningless (in a strong sense), and so incapable of articulating genuine facts. But this isn't compelling (says Horwich) for there is an adequate theory of meaning (a use theory of meaning) that can account in a unified way for the meaning of all sentences. [This seems like a rather bold claim to make.]

2) Some phenomena are taken to be weird, so it may be best to explain their weirdness by disabusing us from thinking that those things are FACTUAL. Horwich objects that what happens is that we imagine them as being physical, concrete, etc, and that is why they seem weird. (Our paradigm of objects are concrete objects, so we think that all objects must share some features with these, and we are puzzled when we can't find abstract objects. This seems rather strange to me, though somewhat attractive.)

3) It is assumed to be of great importance to have a neat distinction between what is factual and what is not. But is this really important? Is there a uniquely important distinction? 

Horwich goes on to discuss potential objections. (The second objection reminds one of Boghossian's criticism of deflationists "all over the board", and the answer to it by Kraut.) A final suggestion is that many of the uses to which Fine wants to put his proposal may well be served by the notion of ground, without assuming that there is any sort of connection with FACTUALITY. },

@article{shimoyama2006,
	Abstract = {This paper examines the question of how so-called indeterminate phrases in Japanese (Kuroda 1965) associate with relevant particles higher in the structure. In the universal construction in Japanese, the restrictor (provided by an indeterminate phrase) sometimes appears to be separate from the universal particle mo . It is proposed that quantification at a distance is only apparent, and that the restriction is in fact provided locally by the sister constituent of mo as a whole. The proposal leads us to a straightforward uniform picture of the syntax-semantics mapping of the universal construction and wh-questions, building upon Hamblin's (1973) semantics for wh-phrases as sets of alternatives. It allows for a switch of perspective on a long-standing puzzle regarding locality effects in the indeterminate--particle association by deriving the locality pattern from the way indeterminate phrases are interpreted and associated with particles, without any stipulations.},

In the present paper we will extend the theory to include a number of new factors, in particular the effect of noise in the channel, and the savings possible due to the statistical structure of the original message and due to the nature of the final destination of the information.},

In this article, we make this norm mathematically precise. We describe epistemic dilemmas an agent might face if she attempts to follow Accuracy and show that the only measures of inaccuracy that do not create these dilemmas are the quadratic inaccuracy measures. In the sequel, we derive Bayesianism from Accuracy and show that Jeffrey Conditionalization violates Accuracy unless Rigidity is assumed. We describe the alternative updating rule that Accuracy mandates in the absence of Rigidity.},

The relation of proper scoring rules to other economic devices and to the foundations of the personalistic theory of probability is brought out. The implications of various restrictions, especially symmetry restrictions, on scoring rules is explored, usually with a minimum of regularity hypothesis.},

@incollection{heck2007,
	Abstract = {Many philosophers have been attracted to the idea that meaning is, in some way or other, determined by use---{}chief among them, perhaps, Michael Dummett. But John McDowell has argued that Dummett, and anyone else who would seek to draw serious philosophical conclusions from this claim, must face a dilemma: Either the use of a sentence is characterized in terms of what it can be used to say, in which case profound philosophical consequences can hardly follow, or it will be impossible to make out the sense in which the use of language is a rational activity. The paper evaluates McDowell's arguments and, in so doing, attempts to offer an initial sketch of how the notion of use might be so understood that the claim that use determines meaning is a substantive one. (I do not take any stand here on whether one should accept that claim.)},

	Abstract = {In chapter five of Wise Choices, Apt Feelings Allan Gibbard develops what he calls a \textquoteleft{}normative logic\textquoteright intended to solve some problems that face an expressivist theory of norms like his. The first is \textquotedblleft{}the problem of embedding: The analysis applies to simple contexts, in which it is simply asserted or denied that such-and-such is rational. It says nothing about more complex normative assertions.\textquotedblright{}1 That is the problem with which I will be concerned. Though he doesn\textquoteright{}t list it as one of the problems to be solved, Gibbard\textquoteright{}s devices also explain what it means to say that a certain normative argument is \textquoteleft{}valid\textquoteright, that one normative statement follows from some others. Both of these questions arise because of the ways we ordinarily think and speak, ways which on a simplistic version of expressivism appear not to make any sense. An expressivist committed to making sense of the way we ordinarily think and speak in normative language owes some account of embeddings and of logic. Gibbard\textquoteright{}s device seems to me the clearest and most systematic of any expressivist attempt to meet these challenges.},

	Abstract = {The formal conception of computation ({FCC}) holds that computational processes are not sensitive to semantic properties. {FCC} is popular, but it faces well-known difficulties. Accordingly, authors such as Block and Peacocke pursue a ?semantically-laden? alternative, according to which computation can be sensitive to semantics. I argue that computation is insensitive to semantics within a wide range of computational systems, including any system with ?derived? rather than ?original? intentionality. {FCC} yields the correct verdict for these systems. I conclude that there is only one promising strategy for semantically-laden theorists: identify special computational systems that help generate their own semantic properties, and then show that computation within those systems is semantically-laden. Unfortunately, the few existing discussions that pursue this strategy are problematic.},

	Abstract = {Computationalism has been the mainstream view of cognition for decades. There are periodic reports of its demise, but they are greatly exaggerated. This essay surveys some recent literature on computationalism and reaches the following conclusions. Computationalism is a family of theories about the mechanisms of cognition. The main relevant evidence for testing computational theories comes from neuroscience, though psychology and {AI} are relevant too. Computationalism comes in many versions, which continue to guide competing research programs in philosophy of mind as well as psychology and neuroscience. Although our understanding of computationalism has deepened in recent years, much work in this area remains to be done.},

	Abstract = {{ABSTRACT} The goal of this paper is to make sense of relativism about truth. There are two key ideas. (1) To be a relativist about truth is to allow that a sentence or proposition might be assessment-sensitive: that is, its truth value might vary with the context of assessment as well as the context of use. (2) Making sense of relativism is a matter of understanding what it would be to commit oneself to the truth of an assessment-sensitive sentence or proposition.},

	Abstract = {Nonfactualism--the model here is Allan Gibbard's highly insightful "Wise Choice, Apt Feelings"-- is a very dramatic philosophical response to normative discourse. It requires a nonstandard semantic theory that nonetheless mimics, and dovetails with, standard assertoric semantics. Moreover, it yields a dualism about concepts with explanatory as well as normative uses--e.g., "reason for action", "meaning", "good", and many others (if one assumes meaning holism, language is pervaded with normativity). Gibbard's account may be unable to yield the fact/value distinction he seeks, which is meant to be term-by-term, conservative of the "Galilean core", and itself factual.},

@article{portner2007,
	Abstract = {Imperatives may be interpreted with many subvarieties of directive force, for example as orders, invitations, or pieces of advice. I argue that the range of meanings that imperatives can convey should be identified with the variety of interpretations that are possible for non-dynamic root modals (what I call 'priority modals'), including deontic, bouletic, and teleological readings. This paper presents an analysis of the relationship between imperatives and priority modals in discourse which asserts that, just as declaratives contribute to the Common Ground and thus provide information relevant to the interpretation of epistemic modals in subsequent discourse, imperatives contribute to another component of the discourse context, the addressee's {To-Do} List, which serves as a contextual resource for the interpretation of priority modals. This analysis predicts that the interpretation of imperatives and modals in discourse is constrained in surprising ways; these predictions are borne out.},

@book{carey2009,
	Abstract = {Only human beings have a rich conceptual repertoire with concepts like tort, entropy, Abelian group, mannerism, icon and deconstruction. How have humans constructed these concepts? And once they have been constructed by adults, how do children acquire them? While primarily focusing on the second question, in The Origin of Concepts , Susan Carey shows that the answers to both overlap substantially. Carey begins by characterizing the innate starting point for conceptual development, namely systems of core cognition. Representations of core cognition are the output of dedicated input analyzers, as with perceptual representations, but these core representations differ from perceptual representations in having more abstract contents and richer functional roles. Carey argues that the key to understanding cognitive development lies in recognizing conceptual discontinuities in which new representational systems emerge that have more expressive power than core cognition and are also incommensurate with core cognition and other earlier representational systems. Finally, Carey fleshes out Quinian bootstrapping, a learning mechanism that has been repeatedly sketched in the literature on the history and philosophy of science. She demonstrates that Quinian bootstrapping is a major mechanism in the construction of new representational resources over the course of childrens cognitive development. Carey shows how developmental cognitive science resolves aspects of long-standing philosophical debates about the existence, nature, content, and format of innate knowledge. She also shows that understanding the processes of conceptual development in children illuminates the historical process by which concepts are constructed, and transforms the way we think about philosophical problems about the nature of concepts and the relations between language and thought},

@article{mcpherson2011,
	Abstract = {Recently, some philosophers have suggested that a form of robust realism about ethics, or normativity more generally, does not face a significant explanatory burden in metaphysics. I call this view metaphysically quietist normative realism . This paper argues that while this view can appear to constitute an attractive alternative to more traditional forms of normative realism, it cannot deliver on this promise. I examine Scanlon's attempt to defend such a quietist realism, and argue that rather than silencing metaphysical questions about normative reasons, his defense at best succeeds only in shifting the focus of metaphysical enquiry. I then set aside the details of Scanlon's view, and argue on general grounds that that the quietist realist cannot finesse a crucial metanormative task: to explain the contrast between the correct normative system and alternative putatively normative standards.},

	Abstract = {The official model of explanation proposed by the logical empiricists, the covering law model, is subject to familiar objections. The goal of the present paper is to explore an unofficial view of explanation which logical empiricists have sometimes suggested, the view of explanation as unification. I try to show that this view can be developed so as to provide insight into major episodes in the history of science, and that it can overcome some of the most serious difficulties besetting the covering law model.},

	Abstract = {Normativity involves two kinds of relation. On the one hand, there is the relation of being a reason for. This is a relation between a fact and an attitude. On the other hand, there are relations specified by requirements of rationality. These are relations among a person's attitudes, viewed in abstraction from the reasons for them. I ask how the normativity of rationality---{}the sense in which we \textquoteleft{}ought\textquoteright to comply with requirements of rationality---{}is related to the normativity of reasons---{}the sense in which we \textquoteleft{}ought\textquoteright to have the attitudes what we have conclusive reason to have. The normativity of rationality is not straightforwardly that of reasons, I argue; there are no reasons to comply with rational requirements in general. First, this would lead to \textquoteleft{}bootstrapping\textquoteright, because, contrary to the claims of John Broome, not all rational requirements have \textquoteleft{}wide scope\textquoteright. Second, it is unclear what such reasons to be rational might be. Finally, we typically do not, and in many cases could not, treat rational requirements as reasons. Instead, I suggest, rationality is only apparently normative, and the normativity that it appears to have is that of reasons. According to this \textquoteleft{}Transparency Account\textquoteright, rational requirements govern our responses to our beliefs about reasons. The normative \textquoteleft{}pressure\textquoteright that we feel, when rational requirements apply to us, derives from these beliefs: from the reasons that, as it seems to us, we have.},

	Abstract = {Hartry Field has shown us a way to be nominalists: we must purge our scientific theories of quantification over abstracta and we must prove the appropriate conservativeness results. This is not a path for the faint hearted. Indeed, the substantial technical difficulties facing Field's project have led some to explore other, easier options. Recently, Jody Azzouni, Joseph Melia, and Stephen Yablo have argued (in different ways) that it is a mistake to read our ontological commitments simply from what the quantifiers of our best scientific theories range over. In this paper, I argue that all three arguments fail and they fail for much the same reason; would-be nominalists are thus left facing Field's hard road.},

The original volume remains a central point of reference, and a focus of controversy, with its impact extending into linguistic theory, philosophy of mind, and epistemology. Addressing a central question--what it is for words to mean what they do--and featuring a previously uncollected, additional essay, this work will appeal to a wide audience of philosophers, linguists, and psychologists},

	Abstract = {Every expressivist theory of moral language requires a solution to the {Frege-Geach} problem, i.e., the problem of explaining how moral sentences retain their meaning in unasserted (e.g., conditional and disjunctive) contexts. An essential part of Blackburn's 'quasi-realist project', i.e., the project of showing how we can earn the right to treat moral sentences as if they have ordinary truth-conditions, is to provide a sophisticated solution. I show, however, that simple negated contexts provide a fundamental difficulty, since accepting the negation of a sentence is easily confused with merely refusing to accept that sentence. I argue that Blackburn's model-set semantics for his 'Hooray!' and 'Boo!' operators requires logical apparatus to which he is not entitled. I consider various modifications, but show that they do not succeed. email : n.unwin@bolton.ac.uk},

	Abstract = {{Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;The} paper outlines a view of normativity that combines elements of relativism and expressivism, and applies it to normative concepts in epistemology. The result is a kind of epistemological anti-realism, which denies that epistemic norms can be (in any straightforward sense) correct or incorrect; it does allow some to be better than others, but takes this to be goal-relative and is skeptical of the existence of best norms. It discusses the circularity that arises from the fact that we need to use epistemic norms to gather the facts with which to evaluate epistemic norms; relatedly, it discusses how epistemic norms can rationally evolve. It concludes with some discussion of the impact of this view on  '' ground level'' epistemology.},

	Abstract = {Although all mathematical truths are necessary, mathematicians take certain combinations of mathematical truths to be 'coincidental', 'accidental', or 'fortuitous'. The notion of a 'mathematical coincidence' has so far failed to receive sufficient attention from philosophers. I argue that a mathematical coincidence is not merely an unforeseen or surprising mathematical result, and that being a misleading combination of mathematical facts is neither necessary nor sufficient for qualifying as a mathematical coincidence. I argue that although the components of a mathematical coincidence may possess a common explainer, they have no common explanation; that two mathematical facts have a unified explanation makes their truth non-coincidental. I suggest that any motivation we may have for thinking that there are mathematical coincidences should also motivate us to think that there are mathematical explanations, since the notion of a mathematical coincidence can be understood only in terms of the notion of a mathematical explanation. I also argue that the notion of a mathematical coincidence plays an important role in scientific explanation. When two phenomenological laws of nature are similar, despite concerning physically distinct processes, it may be that any correct scientific explanation of their similarity proceeds by revealing their similarity to be no mathematical coincidence.},

	Abstract = {Abstract A number of people have recently argued for a structural approach to accounting for the applications of mathematics. Such an approach has been called  '' the mapping account''. According to this view, the applicability of mathematics is fully accounted for by appreciating the relevant structural similarities between the empirical system under study and the mathematics used in the investigation of that system. This account of applications requires the truth of applied mathematical assertions, but it does not require the existence of mathematical objects. In this paper, we discuss the shortcomings of this account, and show how these shortcomings can be overcome by a broader view of the application of mathematics: the inferential conception.},

This is not a path for the faint hearted. Indeed, the substantial technical difficulties facing Field's project have led some to explore other, easier options. Recently, Jody Azzouni, Joseph Melia, and Stephen Yablo have argued (in different ways) that it is a mistake to read our ontological commitments simply from what the quantifiers of our best scientific theories range over.

	Abstract = {The theory of fast and frugal heuristics, developed in a new book called Simple Heuristics that make Us Smart (Gigerenzer, Todd, and the ABC Research Group, in press), includes two requirements for rational decision making. One is that decision rules are bounded in their rationality --- that rules are frugal in what they take into account, and therefore fast in their operation. The second is that the rules are ecologically adapted to the environment, which means that they `fit to reality.' The main purpose of this article is to apply these ideas to learning rules---methods for constructing, selecting, or evaluating competing hypotheses in science, and to the methodology of machine learning, of which connectionist learning is a special case. The bad news is that ecological validity is particularly difficult to implement and difficult to understand. The good news is that it builds an important bridge from normative psychology and machine learning to recent work in the philosophy of science, which considers predictive accuracy to be a primary goal of science.},

@article{wallace2001,
	Abstract = {This paper addresses some connections between conceptions of the will and the theory of practical reason. The first two sections argue against the idea that volitional commitments should be understood along the lines of endorsement of normative principles. A normative account of volition cannot make sense of akrasia, and it obscures an important difference between belief and intention. Sections three and four draw on the non-normative conception of the will in an account of instrumental rationality. The central problem is to explain the grip of instrumental requirements even in cases in which agents do not fully endorse the ends they are pursuing. The solution I propose appeals to coherence constraints on the beliefs that condition the distinctive volitional stance of intention.},

@book{schroeder2008b,
	Abstract = {Expressivism - the sophisticated contemporary incarnation of the noncognitivist research program of Ayer, Stevenson, and Hare - is no longer the province of metaethicists alone. Its comprehensive view about the nature of both normative language and normative thought has also recently been applied to many topics elsewhere in philosophy - including logic, probability, mental and linguistic content, knowledge, epistemic modals, belief, the a priori, and even quantifiers. Yet the semantic commitments of expressivism are still poorly understood and have not been very far developed. As argued within, expressivists have not yet even managed to solve the "negation problem" - to explain why atomic normative sentences are inconsistent with their negations. As a result, it is far from clear that expressivism even could be true, let alone whether it is. Being For seeks to evaluate the semantic commitments of expressivism, by showing how an expressivist semantics would work, what it can do, and what kind of assumptions would be required, in order for it to do it. Building on a highly general understanding of the basic ideas of expressivism, it argues that expressivists can solve the negation problem - but only in one kind of way. It shows how this insight paves the way for an explanatorily powerful, constructive expressivist semantics, which solves many of what have been taken to be the deepest problems for expressivism. But it also argues that no account with these advantages can be generalized to deal with constructions like tense, modals, or binary quantifiers. Expressivism, the book argues, is coherent and interesting, but false},

	Abstract = {Simon Blackburn puts forward a compelling and original philosophy of human motivation and morality. Why do we behave as we do? Can we improve? Is our ethics at war with our passions, or is it an upshot of those passions? Blackburn seeks the answers to such questions in an exploration of the nature of moral emotions and the structures of human motivation. He develops a naturalistic ethics, which integrates our understanding of ethics with the rest of our understanding of the world we live in. His theory does not debunk the ethical by reducing it to the non-ethical, and it banishes the spectres of scepticism and relativism that have haunted recent moral philosophy. Ruling Passions reveals how ethics can maintain its authority even though it is rooted in the very emotions and motivations that it exists to control.},

	Abstract = {{Suppose the members of a group (e.g., committee, jury, expert panel) each form a judgment on which worlds in a given set are possible, subject to the constraint that at least one world is possible but not all are. The group seeks to aggregate these individual judgments into a collective judgment, subject to the same constraint. I show that no judgment aggregation rule can solve this problem in accordance with three conditions:  unanimity,   independence  and  non-dictatorship,  Although the result is a variant of an existing theorem on  group identification  (Kasher and Rubinstein, Logique et Analyse 160:385--395, 1997), the aggregation of judgments on which worlds are possible (or permissible, desirable, etc.) appears not to have been studied yet. The result challenges us to take a stance on which of its conditions to relax.}},

	Abstract = {10.1093/bjps/51.2.197 This paper describes an alternative to the common view that explanation in the special sciences involves subsumption under laws. According to this alternative, whether or not a generalization can be used to explain has to do with whether it is invariant rather than with whether it is lawful. A generalization is invariant if it is stable or robust in the sense that it would continue to hold under a relevant if it is stable or robust in the sense that it would continue to hold under a relevant class of changes. Unlike lawfulness, invariance comes in degrees and has other features that are well suited to capture the characteristics of explanatory generalizations in the special sciences. For example, a generalization can be invariant even if it has exceptions or holds only over a limited spatio-temporal interval. The notion of invariance can be used to resolve a number of dilemmas that arise in standard treatments of explanatory generalizations in the special sciences.},

	Abstract = {We set up a general framework for higher order probabilities. A simple HOP (Higher Order Probability space) consists of a probability space and an operation <i>PR</i>, such that, for every event <i>A</i> and every real closed interval Δ, <i>PR(A, Δ)</i> is the event that <i>A</i>'s "true" probability lies in Δ. (The "true" probability can be construed here either as the objective probability, or the probability assigned by an expert, or the one assigned eventually in a fuller state of knowledge.) In a general HOP the operation <i>PR</i> has also an additional argument ranging over an ordered set of time-points, or, more generally, over a partially ordered set of stages; <i>PR(A, t, Δ)</i> is the event that <i>A</i>'s probability at stage <i>t</i> lies in δ. First we investigate simple HOPs and then the general ones. Assuming some intuitively justified axioms, we derive the most general structure of such a space. We also indicate various connections with modal logic.},

@article{egan2008,
	Abstract = {On many of the idealized models of human cognition and behavior in use by philosophers, agents are represented as having a single corpus of beliefs which (a) is consistent and deductively closed, and (b) guides all of their (rational, deliberate, intentional) actions all the time. In graded-belief frameworks, agents are represented as having a single, coherent distribution of credences, which guides all of their (rational, deliberate, intentional) actions all of the time. It\^{a}s clear that actual human beings don\^{a}t live up to this idealization. The systems of belief that we in fact have are fragmented. Rather than having a single system of beliefs that guides all of our behavior all of the time, we have a number of distinct, compartmentalized systems of belief, different ones of which drive different aspects of our behavior in different contexts. It\^{a}s tempting to think that, while of course people are fragmented, it would be better (from the perspective of rationality) if they weren\^{a}t, and the only reason why our fragmentation is excusable is that we have limited cognitive resources, which prevents us from holding too much information before our minds at a time. Give us enough additional processing capacity, and there\^{a}d be no justification for any continued fragmentation. I argue that this is not so. There are good reasons to be fragmented rather than unified, independent of the limitations on our available processing power. In particular, there are ways our belief-forming mechanisms\^{a}including our perceptual systems\^{a}could be constructed that would make it better to be fragmented than to be unified. And there are reasons to think that some of our belief-forming mechanisms really are constructed that way.},

@article{horwich2008,
	Abstract = {Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;This paper offers a critique of mainstream formal semantics. It begins with a statement of widely assumed adequacy conditions: namely, that a good theory must (1) explain relations of entailment, (ii) show how the meanings of complex expressions derive from the meanings of their parts, and (iii) characterize facts of meaning in truth-theoretic terms. It then proceeds to criticize the orthodox conception of semantics that is articulated in these three desiderata. This critique is followed by a sketch of an alternative conception---one that is argued to be more in tune with the empirical objectives of linguistics and the clarificatory aims of philosophy. Finally, the paper proposes and defends a specific theoretical approach---use based rather than truth based---that is suggested by that alternative conception.},

	Annote = {Field argues that certain `narrow' intentional notions are needed in order to get IT-approaches to content off the ground. These include relations of sameness of content, incompatibility of contents, etc. (p. 105)

The argument is roughly this. Assignments of truth-conditions to belief states are cheap. So it is always possible to find an assignment of truth-conditions that makes the agent more reliable than the `natural' assignment. Field thinks the solution to this is to impose a `systematicity' constraint on assignments of content. And to cash out this notion of systematicity, we need to have independently explicable relations of consistency and implication among states of the agent.

He further thinks that these relations must be cashed out in computational terms, but I don't see why that needs to be so. 

[Note: I wonder whether this problem arises for more `realist' approached to content. E.g. if we follow Dretske, are we also forced into this sort of indeterminacy?] },

	Abstract = {Expressivism's central idea is that normative sentences bear the same relation to non-cognitive attitudes that ordinary descriptive sentences bear to beliefs: the expression relation. Allan Gibbard tells us that "that words express judgments will be accepted by almost everyone"2013 the distinctive contribution of expressivism, his claim goes, is only a view about what kind of judgments words express. But not every account of the expression relation is equally suitable for the expressivist's purposes. In fact, what I argue in this paper, considering four possible accounts of expression, is that how suitable each account is for the expressivist's purpose varies in proportion to how controversial it is. So Gibbard is wrong 2013 if expression is to get expressivism off the ground, then it will be enormously controversial whether words do express judgments. And thus expressivism is committed to strong claims about the semantics of non-normative language.},

	Abstract = { Generating and evaluating explanations is spontaneous, ubiquitous and fundamental to our sense of understanding. Recent evidence suggests that in the course of an individual's reasoning, engaging in explanation can have profound effects on the probability assigned to causal claims, on how properties are generalized and on learning. These effects follow from two properties of the structure of explanations: explanations accommodate novel information in the context of prior beliefs, and do so in a way that fosters generalization. The study of explanation thus promises to shed light on core cognitive issues, such as learning, induction and conceptual representation. Moreover, the influence of explanation on learning and inference presents a challenge to theories that neglect the roles of prior knowledge and explanation-based reasoning. },

	Abstract = {Teleological explanations (TEs) account for the existence or properties of an entity in terms of a function: we have hearts because they pump blood, and telephones for communication. While many teleological explanations seem appropriate, others are clearly not warranted---for example, that rain exists for plants to grow. Five experiments explore the theoretical commitments that underlie teleological explanations. With the analysis of [Wright, L. (1976). Teleological Explanations . Berkeley, CA: University of California Press] from philosophy as a point of departure, we examine in Experiment 1 whether teleological explanations are interpreted causally, and confirm that TEs are only accepted when the function invoked in the explanation played a causal role in bringing about what is being explained. However, we also find that playing a causal role is not sufficient for all participants to accept TEs. Experiment 2 shows that this is not because participants fail to appreciate the causal structure of the scenarios used as stimuli. In Experiments 3--5 we show that the additional requirement for TE acceptance is that the process by which the function played a causal role must be general in the sense of conforming to a predictable pattern. These findings motivate a proposal, Explanation for Export, which suggests that a psychological function of explanation is to highlight information likely to subserve future prediction and intervention. We relate our proposal to normative accounts of explanation from philosophy of science, as well as to claims from psychology and artificial intelligence.},

	Abstract = {Concept learning is challenging in part because the meanings of many concepts depend on their relationships to other concepts. Learning these concepts in isolation can be difficult, but we present a model that discovers entire systems of related concepts. These systems can be viewed as simple theories that specify the concepts that exist in a domain, and the laws or principles that relate these concepts. We apply our model to several real-world problems, including learning the structure of kinship systems and learning ontologies. We also compare its predictions to data collected in two behavioral experiments. Experiment 1 shows that our model helps to explain how simple theories are acquired and used for inductive inference. Experiment 2 suggests that our model provides a better account of theory discovery than a more traditional alternative that focuses on features rather than relations.},

	Abstract = {10.1073/pnas.0802631105 Algorithms for finding structure in data have become increasingly important both as tools for scientific data analysis and as models of human learning, yet they suffer from a critical limitation. Scientists discover qualitatively new forms of structure in observed data: For instance, Linnaeus recognized the hierarchical organization of biological species, and Mendeleev recognized the periodic structure of the chemical elements. Analogous insights play a pivotal role in cognitive development: Children discover that object category labels can be organized into hierarchies, friendship networks are organized into cliques, and comparative relations (e.g.,  '' bigger than'' or  '' better than'') respect a transitive order. Standard algorithms, however, can only learn structures of a single form that must be specified in advance: For instance, algorithms for hierarchical clustering create tree structures, whereas algorithms for dimensionality-reduction create low-dimensional spaces. Here, we present a computational model that learns structures of many different forms and that discovers which form is best for a given dataset. The model makes probabilistic inferences over a space of graph grammars representing trees, linear orders, multidimensional spaces, rings, dominance hierarchies, cliques, and other forms and successfully discovers the underlying structure of a variety of physical, biological, and social domains. Our approach brings structure learning methods closer to human abilities and may lead to a deeper computational understanding of cognitive development.},

	Abstract = {doi: 10.1086/505186 In three recent papers, Wayne Myrvold (1996, 2003) and Timothy McGrew (2003) have developed Bayesian accounts of the virtue of unification. In his account, McGrew demonstrates that, ceteris paribus, a hypothesis that unifies its evidence will have a higher posterior probability than a hypothesis that does not. Myrvold, on the other hand, offers a specific measure of unification that can be applied to individual hypotheses. He argues that one must account for this measure in order to calculate correctly the degree of confirmation that a hypothesis receives from its evidence. Using the probability calculus, I prove that the two accounts of unification require the same underlying inequality; thus, McGrew and Myrvold have accounted for unification in fundamentally identical probabilistic terms. I then evaluate five putative counterexamples to this account and show that these examples, far from disqualifying it, serve to clarify our notion of unification by disentangling it from a host of other concepts.},

	Abstract = {Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp; Ceteris-paribus clauses are nothing to worry about; aceteris-paribus qualifier is not poisonously indeterminate in meaning. Ceteris-paribus laws teach us that a law need not be associated straightforwardly with a regularity in the manner demanded by regularity analyses of law and analyses of laws as relations among universals. This lesson enables us to understand the sense in which the laws of nature would have been no different under various counterfactual suppositions --- a feature even of those laws that involve no ceteris-paribus qualification and are actually associated with exceptionless regularities. Ceteris-paribus generalizations of an'inexact science' qualify as laws of that science in virtue of their distinctive relation to counterfactuals: they form a set that is stable for the purposes of that field. (Though an accident may possess tremendous resilience under counterfactual suppositions, the laws are sharply distinguished from the accidents in that the laws are collectively as resilient as they could logically possibly be.) The stability of an inexact science's laws may involve their remaining reliable even under certain counterfactual suppositions violating fundamental laws of physics. The ceteris-paribus laws of an inexact science may thus possess a kind of necessity lacking in the fundamental laws of physics. A nomological explanation supplied by an inexact science would then be irreducible to an explanation of the same phenomenon at the level of fundamental physics. Island biogeography is used to illustrate how a special science could be autonomous in this manner.},

	Abstract = {Traditional analyses of the curve fitting problem maintain that the data do not indicate what form the fitted curve should take. Rather, this issue is said to be settled by prior probabilities, by simplicity, or by a bacgkround theory. In this paper, we describe a result due to Akaike [1973], which shows how the data can underwrite an inference concerning the curve's form based on an estimate of how predictively accurate it will be. We argue that this approach throws light on the theoretical virtues of parsimoniousness, unification, and non ad hocness, on the dispute about Bayesianism, and on empiricism and scientific realism.},

	Abstract = {Recent solutions to the curve-fitting problem, described in Forster and Sober ([1995]), trade off the simplicity and fit of hypotheses by defining simplicity as the paucity of adjustable parameters. Scott De Vito ([1997]) charges that these solutions are 'conventional' because he thinks that the number of adjustable parameters may change when the hypotheses are described differently. This he believes is exactly what is illustrated in Goodman's new riddle of induction, otherwise known as the grue problem. However, the 'number of adjustable parameters' is actually a loose way of referring to a quantity that is not language dependent. The quantity arises out of Akaike's theorem in a way that ensures its language invariance. 10.1093/bjps/50.1.83},

	Abstract = {We propose new definitions of (causal) explanation, using structural equations to model counterfactuals. The definition is based on the notion of actual cause, as defined and motivated in a companion article. Essentially, an explanation is a fact that is not known for certain but, if found to be true, would constitute an actual cause of the fact to be explained, regardless of the agent's initial uncertainty. We show that the definition handles well a number of problematic examples from the literature.

	Abstract = {Recently, much attention has been paid to 'rational requirements' and, especially, to what I call 'rational requirements of formal coherence as such'. These requirements are satisfied just when our attitudes are formally coherent: for example, when our beliefs do not contradict each other. Nevertheless, these requirements are puzzling. In particular, it is unclear why we should satisfy them. In light of this, I explore the conjecture that there are no requirements of formal coherence. I do so by trying to construct a theory of error for the idea that there are such requirements.},

Aggregation is viewed here as a single-profile exercise. We show that affine rules are the only solutions to the problem of aggregating nonatomic probabilities. Assuming weak Pareto conditions and technical restrictions, we show that dictatorial rules are the only solutions to the problem of aggregating Savagean orderings. No solution exists when strong Pareto replaces weaker conditions. Without technical restrictions of affine independence, nontrivial solutions may exist.

	Abstract = {doi: 10.1086/519477 Signaling games provide basic insights into some fundamental questions concerning the explanation of meaning. They can be analyzed in terms of rational choice theory and in terms of evolutionary game theory. It is argued that an evolutionary approach provides better explanations for the emergence of simple communication systems. To substantiate these arguments, I will look at models similar to those of Skyrms (2000) and Komarova and Niyogi (2004) and study their dynamical properties. My results will lend partial support to the thesis that evolution leads to communication. In general, states of partial communication may evolve with positive probability under standard evolutionary dynamics. However, unlike states of perfect communication, they are unstable relative to neutral drift.},

Explanations having this feature must appeal to generalizations that are invariant--stable under certain sorts of changes. These ideas are illustrated by examples drawn from physics and econometrics.},

@article{grimm2008,
	Abstract = {Explanatory inquiry characteristically begins with a certain puzzlement about the world. But why do certain situations elicit our puzzlement (or curiosity) while others leave us, in some epistemically relevant sense, cold? Moreover, what exactly is involved in the move from a state of puzzlement to a state where one's puzzlement is satisfied? In this paper I try to answer both of these questions. I also suggest ways in which our account of scientific rationality might benefit from having a better sense of the kind of epistemic goal we are trying to realize, when we engage in our explanatory inquiries.

	Abstract = {This paper discusses counterexamples to the thesis that the probabilities of conditionals are conditional probabilities. It is argued that the discrepancy is systematic and predictable, and that conditional probabilities are crucially involved in the apparently deviant interpretations. Furthermore, the examples suggest that such conditionals have a less prominent reading on which their probability is in fact the conditional probability, and that the two readings are related by a simple step of abductive inference. Central to the proposal is a distinction between causal and purely stochastic dependence between variables.},

Several authors have explored ways to assign probabilities to such sentences, but those proposals have come under criticism for making counterintuitive predictions. This paper examines the source of the problematic predictions and proposes an amendment which corrects them in a principled way. The account brings intuitions about counterfactual conditionals to bear on the interpretation of indicatives and relies on the notion of causal (in)dependence.},

	Abstract = {ABSTRACT\&nbsp;\&nbsp;The connection between the probabilities of conditionals and the corresponding conditional probabilities has long been explored in the philosophical literature, but its implementation faces both technical obstacles and objections on empirical grounds. In this paper I ?rst outline the motivation for the probabilistic turn and Lewis' triviality results, which stand in the way of what would seem to be its most straightforward implementation. I then focus on Richard Jeffrey's 'random-variable' approach, which circumvents these problems by giving up the notion that conditionals denote propositions in the usual sense. Even so, however, the random-variable approach makes counterintuitive predictions in simple cases of embedded conditionals. I propose to address this problem by enriching the model with an explicit representation of causal dependencies. The addition of such causal information not only remedies the shortcomings of Jeffrey's conditional, but also opens up the possibility of a uni?ed probabilistic account of indicative and counterfactual conditionals.},

	Abstract = {doi: 10.1086/524714 Lewis sender‐receiver games illustrate how a meaningful term language might evolve from initially meaningless random signals (Lewis 1969; Skyrms 2006). Here we consider how a meaningful language with a primitive grammar might evolve in a somewhat more subtle sort of game. The evolution of such a language involves the co‐evolution of partitions of the physical world into what may seem, at least from the perspective of someone using the language, to correspond to canonical natural kinds. While the evolved language may allow for the sort of precise representation that is required for successful coordinated action and prediction, the apparent natural kinds reflected in its structure may be purely conventional. This has both positive and negative implications for the limits of naturalized metaphysics.},

	Abstract = {Conclusion The discussion above indicates that there is some reason for optimism with regard to the project of incorporating logical-mathematical learning within Bayesianism, though it is obvious that there are many difficulties to be overcome. The biggest obstacle in this regard is overcoming the tension that exists between considerations of formal tractability and the desire to avoid demanding too much of rational agents. Jeffrey's solution seems more flexible in this regard than Garber's, but that may very well be because the general mechanisms underlying Jeffrey's rule of reparation have not been specified. In any case, in my view the verdict we should draw with regard to the problem of old evidence is a bit more pessimistic. Jeffrey's and Garber's solutions only address certain aspects of the problem, and thus can only provide partial solutions at best. The basic strategy of using logical-mathematical learning to induce a confirmation event does not completely evade the problem, which reemerges when the required logical-mathematical knowledge becomes old news. Thus, despite the  '' solutions'' that have been offered to date, the problem of old evidence remains a fundamental challenge to the Bayesian point of view.},

	Abstract = {The basic notion of an objective probability is that of a probability determined by the physical structure of the world. On this understanding, there are subjective credences that do not correspond to objective probabilities, such as credences concerning rival physical theories. The main question for objective probabilities is how they are determined by the physical structure. In this paper, I survey three ways of understanding objective probability: stochastic dynamics, humean chances, and deterministic chances (typicality). The first is the obvious way to understand the probabilities of quantum mechanics via a collapse theory such as GRW, the last is the way to understand the probabilities in the context of a deterministic theory such as Bohmian mechanics. Humean chances provide a more abstract and general account of chances locutions that are independent of dynamical considerations.},

	Abstract = {Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;I argue that one central aspect of the epistemology of causation, the use of causes as evidence for their effects, is largely independent of the metaphysics of causation. In particular, I use the formalism of Bayesian causal graphs to factor the incremental evidential impact of a cause for its effect into a direct cause-to-effect component and a backtracking component. While the  '' backtracking'' evidence that causes provide about earlier events often obscures things, once we our restrict attention to the cause-to-effect component it is true to say promoting (inhibiting) causes raise (lower) the probabilities of their effects. This factoring assumes the same form whether causation is given an interventionist, counterfactual or probabilistic interpretation. Whether we think about causation in terms of interventions and causal graphs, counterfactuals and imaging functions, or probability raising against the background of causally homogenous partitions, if we describe the essential features of a situation correctly then the incremental evidence that a cause provides for its effect in virtue of being its cause will be the same.},

	Abstract = {Epistemic deference is the phenomenon in which one person uses the deliverances of some information source, perhaps the opinions of another person, as a model for what to believe. The paper aims to clarify the nature of epistemic deference in probabilistic contexts, to explain the conditions under which deference is appropriate, and to examine deference to objective chances, as epitomized in David Lewis's Principal Principle. This latter analysis will show, in contrast with views that portray chance as an ideal inductive logician with total recall, that our deference to chance is grounded in contingent limitations on our ability to access information and our recognition that the physical probabilities that instantiate the actual chances codify all the types of information that humans are able to possess.},

	Abstract = {Many philosophers have believed that the laws of nature differ from the accidental truths in their invariance under counterfactual perturbations. Roughly speaking, the laws would still have held had q been the case, for any q that is consistent with the laws. (Trivially, no accident would still have held under every such counterfactual supposition.) The main problem with this slogan (even if it is true) is that it uses the laws themselves to delimit q's range. I present a means of distinguishing the laws (and their logical consequences) from the accidents, in terms of their range of invariance under counterfactual antecedents, that does not appeal to physical modalities (or any cognate notion) in delimiting the relevant range of counterfactual perturbations. I then argue that this approach explicates the sense in which the laws possess a kind of necessity.},

He defends the following principle: 

NP: m is a law iff for any sub-nomic fact p consistent with all the laws, p \boxright m. 

The  main concern here, other than a few qualifications, is that NP is circular. This is a problem not because he wants a reductive analysis of lawhood. Rather, it gets in the way of specifying what is special about the relationship between counterfactuals and laws. 

The proposal is as follows. Let \Gamma be a set of sub-nomic truths. We say that \Gamma is sub-nomically stable iff for any q \in \Gamma and sub-nomic p consistent with all truths in \Gamma, p \boxright q is true (plus or minus the relevant qualifications) in every conversational context. The claim is that the laws is the only non-trivial sub-nomically stable set. },

	Abstract = {On the received view, counterfactuals are analysed using the concept of closeness between possible worlds: the counterfactual  If it had been the case that p, then it would have been the case that q' is true at a world w just in case q is true at all the possible p-worlds closest to w. The degree of closeness between two worlds is usually thought to be determined by weighting different respects of similarity between them. The question I consider in the paper is which weights attach to different respects of similarity. I start by considering Lewis's answer to the question and argue against it by presenting several counterexamples. I use the same examples to motivate a general principle about closeness: if a fact obtains in both of two worlds, then this similarity is relevant to the closeness between them if and only if the fact has the same explanation in the two worlds. I use this principle and some ideas of Lewis's to formulate a general account of counterfactuals, and I argue that this account can explain the asymmetry of counterfactual dependence. The paper concludes with a discussion of some examples that cannot be accommodated by the present version of the account and therefore necessitate further work on the details. 10.1093/mind/fzl261},

@incollection{field1998,
	Address = {Oxford},
	Annote = {1. Through obvious route one gets to reducing the question of objectivity of math to that of objectivity of (choice of) axioms. Field identifies the view that  a mathematical satement is true (if and) only if it can be derived from "explicitly or implicitly accepted axioms" (p. 317) 'extreme anti-objectivism'. Two main features: 

(i) "even when a mathematical statement is 'correct', this will only be as  result of our having explicitly or implicitly adopted axioms from which it is derivable" and thus

(ii) that for undecidable sentences, neither they nor they negations is objectively correct. 

Field goes on to talk bout (ii) for a while, though it's not terribly clear what he has to say. (He wants to say that one should get beyond undecidable number theoretic statements if one is to go anywhere, but his motivation is just that it would seem crazy to accept something short of full decidability for number theoretic statements)

2. Are objects enough for objectivity? FIeld uses Putnam model-theoretic considerations to suggest that they're not. Consistent with what he says, he claims to have an argument for why number-theoretic statements are immune to that sort of considerations (one needs to strengthen the logic to include the quantifier 'only < omega many'. This gives what he calls 'moderate anti-objectivism': there are principle methods for choosing axioms (simplicity, elegance, etc.),  but ' truth' adds nothing to that. (320) "Once you have consistency (in the expanded sense I've indicated), your advocacy of the axioms will be enough to make them true as you intend then. That in effect is what Putnam's argument suggest." (ibid.)

Q: In what sense would this yield "objectivity" (seems surprisingly close to Tait!)? He claims "we can account for whatever mathematical objectivity there is quite independent of any assumptions we make about mathematical truth, using just the objectivity of logic in the slightly expanded sense introduced above." (321) 

3.  He goes on to say that " we seem then to have an argument that on any  view of mathematical truth, whether in terms of mathematical objects or not, mathematical truth does not gives rise to specifically mathematical  objectivity." (322)

Objections: math truth plays a role in the extended notion of logical consequence and math truth plays a role in the notion of utility behind the choice of axioms. The first objection is not very good (Field dixit) and to the second one he responds that truth cannot explain utility since utility is only relative to the purposes at hand. 

NOTE: I'm not convinced by his argument there. he says "Of course, when we find use for prima-facie competing theories, we typically say that the theories don't really compete after all." One appeals to the relative interpretability. "But this move is availabe, whatever the prima-facie competing theories (as long as they're consistent); since it is always available, lack of truth can never be used to rule out a mathematical theory, which is just another way of saying that calling a consistent mathematical theory true seems completely unexplanatory of any utility it may have." This seems hard to swallow, though I don't see how one could respond. 

4. (Some remrks on Fictionalism and why it is not significantly different from other anti-objectivist views) It may also seem (Field says) that there is not much difference between the many-world anti-objectivist and the platonist, unless  the platonist does not accept Putnam's point. 

5. Now we're back to the "access" problem (i.e. Benacerraf...). One way to put B's point: "a theory tends to be undermined if it needs to postulate massive coincidence." 

INTERESTING: ''it is not the mathematical objects per se, but the claims about mathematical objectivity implicit in most standard platonism, that seem to give rise to the most serious problems" (326)

6. (Rant on What numbers could not be)

7. Indispensablity. After cosindering ways of challenging the indispensability arguments, Field talks about whether the success of indispensability arguments should say anyting about objectivity. THe argument would be something like this: "for if we need to regard mathematics as true in order to explain its utility for science or metalogic, then couldn't issues about the truth of disputed hypotheses such as the size of the continuum make a difference to science or metalogic?

Field claims that should an argument would fail, but I can't see why the route to take must be that whether HC is true could make a difference in science. 

The conclusion is that what matters isn't the issue of math objects but that of mathematical objectivity. This conclusion, says Field, is attributed by Putnam 1975 to Kreisel, the diff being that Kreisel thought such an objectivity would go beyond logical objectivity, and Field disagrees. },

	Annote = {How to make sense of the question of realism? 

The puzzle is illustrated by the following pair of statements: 

1) there are infinitely many prime numbers
2) there are no numbers

The antirealist maintains (2). So, what to do about (1)? 

a) The eliminative or skeptical antirealist will deny (1). But this requires a conception of philosophy as having "the epistemological high-ground," (p. 2) and in this age of "post-Moorean modesty" that would be hard to swallow. 
b) The metaphysical antirealist claims that there is a sense in which (1) is true and another one in which (2) is true, so there is no conflict there. This requires, says Fine, a "metaphysical conception of reality" to distinguish what is really the case from what is only apparently the case. Two ways of doing this: 

	i) metaphysical reality is what is "objective". (antifactualism)
	ii) metaphysical reality is what is "irreducible" or "fundamental". (reductionism)

But how to make sense of (i) or (ii)? 

For (i) the puzzle is: how to deny the move from "killing babies for fun is wrong" to "it is a fact that killing babies for fun is wrong"?  (I.e. How to distinguish "quasi-realism" from "realism"?  "[T]he difficulty is in understanding the intended contrast between his world---the real world "out there"---and the world of common mundane fact." (4)

For (ii), the puzzle is how to deny reality to things that are reducible to other things? How to make sense of some mysterious notion of "metaphysical reduction"? 

2. Factuality

One way of getting to nonfactualism is to take the expressivist route and deny that such statements are either true or false. Problem: they obviously seem to be candidates for truth! The noncognitivist must be using "true" and "false" in some "special metaphysically inflated sense that still need to be explained" (4). The problem, in short, is how to distinguish realism from quasi-realism. 

One criterion is Dummett's semantic construal of realism. Of course, received opinion has it that bivalence hods for the contested statements, so this is a form of skepticism or error-theory. Another problem: how to apply the criterion? One would need to associate a statement to an area of discourse, and the answer to whether the statement satisfies the criterion may well depend on what the chosen discourse is [Why not talk about a discourse as a whole?]. Fine thinks this is just some variety of the reference class problem. 

Even if one goes for chunks of discourse, bivalence is not enough to get realism (the opinionated antirealist would not become a realist the day he forms an opinion on the last question): one has to accept bivalence "for the right reason". And what would this be? 

Two suggestions: 

a) Epistemic proposal: the notion of truth should be epistemically unconstrained. 

Is this enough? Fine doesn't think so. Counterexample is rather complicated: 

	One is warranted in asserting p  in a given evidential situation iff the possibility of its vindication is never foreclosed, i.e iff for any improvemet of t there is a further improvement in which the assertion is unwarranted. 

Fine discusses a system close to intuitionistic semantics that validates LEM. He tweaks the semantics to make A assertable just in case not A isn't. He then goes on to discuss possible objections, but I found the whole paragraph highly unclear! The idea he seems to be discussing is that it may be "unknowable" whether there is a further improvement of the evidence that warrants A. Somehow Fine thinks that to make this go through one needs to assume some sort of realist position about evidence, but I can't see why. 

b) Supplement bivalence "semantically": Bivalence must hold as a semantic matter.

Fine appeals to his previous counterexample, and claims this is not enough. Perhaps one could require that the realist accept bivalence and classical logic in its entirety. But what would be the difficulty here? Another requirement: understanding of the language should consist in knowledge of truth-conditions. But is there a way of making sense of this in a way that both implies realism and yet does not presuppose a realist understanding of truth-conditions? 

[Why not think that the distinction can be cashed out from within one of the positions, and not think that one could find some vantage point from which to make them?]

Fine's diagnosis: what makes these criteria seem plausible it's that it's hard to see how to meet them and yet still be a realist. "But it should be recognized that, even though the existence of an external reality may make it plausible that our linguistic and epistemic contact with that reality is of a certain sort, this is not what the externality of the reality consists in." We need to look at these issues as concerning the subject matter of the given discourse, and not our relationship to it. 

Conclusion: there may well not be an adequate formulation of any factualist or non-factualist position at all. 

3. Reducibility

Looking at this criterion, the first question to ask is: what is it for one proposition to be reducible to another one? 

Three lines of response: 

a) Logical analysis, according to which one sentence reduces to another just in case they express the same proposition and the second's logical form is closer to that of the proposition. "Reduction reveals a discrepancy between the "apparent" grammatical form of the sentence and the "genuine" logical form of the proposition and serves to bring the two in closer alignment." (8)

Problems: 

	a1) One-many reductions: Reducing S&T to S and T. [?] Reducing SvT to S (if S is true and T false): the two aren't equivalent. [What?]
	a2) De re reductions: How to say that "the satisfaction of the open sentence `z is married' by the couple Jack and Jill is reducible to the satisfaction of the open sentence `x s married to y' by Jack and Jill"? Since to talk of reduction in this sense on needs a fine-grained account of propositions, one would need to say that the two express different propositions. [Strange, strange. It seems tha thte formulation of (a) is a nonstarter.]

The most difficult problem: problematic notion of logical form. "To maintain that a sentence concerning nations, say, expresses the same proposition, or states the same fact, as one concerning individuals and yet is less close in its form to that proposition or fact is already to buy into a metaphysically loaded conception of logical form." (9)

b) Semantical analysis: One can understand the the reduced sentence in the basis of an understanding of the sentences to which it reduces. 

Problem: 

	b2) De re reductions: "There is, of course, a semantical implication from a's being married to b to a-and-b's being married couple. But this is not what we are after, since we want direct reference to to the couple c." [Why?]
	b3) A posteriori reductions (Water to H20). [But the reductionist may deny that he's after such reductions!]
	b4) Insufficiency of the criterion: one may want to hold on to complex attributes while still acknowledging that there are analytic connections between them and more simple attributes. [Sloppy (me) here, but clear enough]

The lesson to be learnt is that reduction must be taken to be a metaphysical, rather than a linguistic or semantic relation. "In making claims of reduction, we wish to talk, not about our representation of the facts, but about the facts themselves." (10)

c) Reduction as a modal matter: supervenience, for short. Fine claims that this still faces the "reference class" problem, though I can't see why [I should check this], and that it doesn't apply to necessary domains. But still: 

c5) Is is not able to capture the idea of reduction to something more basic. There may be two-ways supervenience, for one. Moreover, even in one-way supervenience, this is not sufficient. Take mass, volume, and density. Each one supervene on the others, and not vice-versa. But which one reduces to which? 

Again, the difficulty is that reducibility seems to be compatible with reducibility: "whatever the sufficient condition might be, its satisfaction would appear to be compatible with a thorough-going realist position, one which took every single fact to be real, and hence compatible with the rejection of any given reductive analysis." (11)

4. The Quietist Challenge

The problem should have been anticipated, for we are looking for a form of antirealism that is not at odds with received opinion. But since the received opinion could be anything, as long as the opinion is stated in "first order terms", things will not work. What guranteed the possibility of a non-skeptical antirealism  is the "general independence of the second-order claims, in this sense, from the first-order propositions with which they deal." (12)

But how can we understand factuality or reducibility if not in first-order terms? This would imply that there be no difference between (first-orderly) between factual and non-factual propositions (e.g.): nonfactual propositions would be like zombies. But then "how are we to distinguish between the two? (...) there would appear to be no vantage point from which we could draw a distinction between what is real and what is merely a "shadow"  cast by our language or thought. There is no stepping behind the putative facts to see what is really there." (12) And this leads to quietism, which throws away the metaphysical enterprise associated with these notions. "Philosophy, on this way of thinking, should abandon its pretension of presenting us with a higher-order view of how the world really is." (12)

But perhaps the problem is that one should define these notions in purely metaphysical terms (doing otherwise would be analogous to the naturalistic fallacy): it would be a mistake to deduce the unintelligibility of metaphysical notions from the difficulty of their being defined in non-metaphysical terms. 

The quietist may have a general hostility towards metaphysical concepts, but he is in no position to justify it (for the obvious reasons). (p. 13) Also, there is evidence of intelligibility. [Is there?]

However, one could be a methodological quietist and not a conceptual one: there may be meaningful notions of factuality, but there is no way to tell what is what. The methodological challenge is the real challenge raised by quietism. 

Fine's goal: to take the intelligibility of metapysical notions for granted and show how one could make progress in settling realist disputes. Strategy: Show how questions of realism might turn on other more tractable questions. 

5. Ground

On what turn the questions of realism? Fine suggests: on questions of ground. 

A statement of ground can be canonically made in the following form: 

Its being the case that S consists in nothing more than its being the case that T, U, ...

The propositions on the right are said to collectively ground the ones on the left. Note that there is no implication of unreality of those propositions that can be grounded on another ones. (Some philosophers, says Fine, have thought of supervenience in roughly these terms.) 

Caveat: no proposition can be said to ground itself. 

Fine takes ground to be an explanatory relation: the truth of P being ground on the truth of Q, R, ... entails that the truth of Q, R, ... can account for the truth of P. In fact, Fine takes the notion of ground to be the "tightest" explanatory connection between propositions. "There is, however, no explanatory connection between propositions that stands to ground as ground stands to these other forms of explanation. It is the ultimate form of explnation; and it is perhaps for this reason that we are not inclined to think  of the truth of a grounded proposition as a further fact over and above its grounds, even though it may be distinct from its grounds and even though it may itself be a real fact." (16)

For Fine, ground is to be seen as a sentential operators. See remarks at the end of {\S}5 for a brief dicussion of what the consequences of this are. I'm not clear on that. 

6. Settling questions of factuality

Outline: argue that questions of factuality turn on questions of ground, and seeing how questions of ground could be settled. Suppose two people disagree on the factual status of a given proposition. Fine claims that their disagreement, as long as their positions are plausible, turn on some question of ground. 

(Example: the nonfactualist will try to "ground" the claim that abortion is wrong (say) on propositions that do not talk about wrongness.)

The argument promises to be complex: 

Stage 1: P is the true proposition upon whose fctual status F and N disagree. If P cannot be ground on other propositions, we say that it's basic. We ask F whether P is basic. If he says "yes", move to Stage 2. Otherwise, we ask him to provide a list L of basic propositions that collectively ground the truth of P (that such a list exist is assumption (a)). If N disagrees that L grounds P, we have a disagreement on ground. Otherwise, N will take some prop (say Q) in L to be nonfactual (this is assumption (b)). The fctualist, will take all in L to be factual (assumption (c)). So they disagree on the factual status of some proposition that the factualist takes to be basic. 

Stage 2: F and N disagree on the factual status of some proposition P that the factualist takes to be basic. SInce propositions are structured entities (assumption), the nonfactualist will take on of P's constituents to be nonfactual (assumption (d)). Let C, D, ... be the constituents of P that N takes to be nonfactual. Fine assumes that at least one of those constituents must be taken to be factual by F (since he assumes F and N agree on whether the proposition would be factual if its constituents were not. [I have no idea what this assumption amounts to.])

Stage 3: F and N disagree on the factual status of some constituent, say C, of P. Now, we say that a proposition contains a given constituent essentially if its replacement by some other constituent induces a change in truth value, and we assume (e) that any nonfactual constituent C is essentially contained in some true factual proposition P+ and that F and N would agree on this. 

Stage 4: F and N agree on the factuality of P+, but disagree on whether C is factual. For N, P+ is imperfectly factual (def) since it is factual but contains some nonfactual contituent. So he will agree (assumption (f)) that P+ has a perfectly factual ground. The factualist, on the other hand, will claim that P+ has no ground one of whose propositions does not contain C (assumption (g)). 

Hence, there is disagreement on a question of ground. 

Now, one needs to defend assumptions (a)-(g). 

(a)-(d) seem OK. For (e), the idea is that any plausible antirealist position will not be "across the board". At least in the sense that the antirealist must concede, for the sake of the argument, that some propositions are factual. 

In support of (f), the idea is that anything factual has purely factual grounds. (p. 20) (If we got rid of the nonfactual, everything factual would remain.)

The argument for (g) is rather obscure. The idea is that if C occurs in some basic factual proposition, then it is a "fundamental element of reality". But if some true factual proposition contains C essentially, it must be in virtue of some feature of C. And C being a fundamental element of reality, this feature cannot be grounded in something that did not contain C itself. 

[Usual worry about the relativity of what the "fundamental elements of reality" are. Als, presupposition of an absolute conception of ground. Is it plausible?]

For Fine, it is crucial to use this notion of ground, for it could be possible (say) that the antirealist and the realist agree that the best explanation of some proposition be given in the same way. [This points to a difficulty in understanding what exactly the notion of ground is, and what the role it's playing is. I am very confused about this.]

7. Settling questions of ground

Can we claim that the notion of ground is kosher from a methodological point of view? There are two main sources of evidence for making judgments of ground: 

a) intuitive evidence. 
b) explanatory evidence: in providing grounds one is explaining, "in the most metaphysically satisfying manner" (22) what makes something true. [How can this be an explanation at all? How is it an explanation that a disjunction is true to say that one of the disjuncts is?] Perhaps the same virtues in assessing explanations are to be looked for here. "[Q]uestions of ground are not simply to be settled on a case-by-case basis but also on how well their answers fit into a general pattern of explanation." (22)

How to assess these considerations? 

Call a given class of propositions whose factuality is in doubt the given domain and the constituents thought to be responsible the contested constituents. Let the extended domain be the set of propositions containing essentially the contested constituents that are agreed to be factual. The extended domain might be taken to describe our "practice" of dealing with the facts constituted by the given domain. 

Focus on the part of our practice that relate to our representation and cognition of the given facts. The extended domain (notice) can also include propositions peculiar to the area in question. Assume that there are aspects of our practices upon whose factuality the two parties agree. In particular, FIne claims, both parties should be willing to acknowledge that there is a factual standard of correctness (p. 23). "There is something of a factual sort that counts as getting things right." 

[It seems to me that this is a substantial assumption to make, but it is still interesting to note that the point of departure is such a difficult one.]

Fine thinks there must also be a factual sense in which someone may be said to be responsive to the facts. "For our epistemic activity must somehow engage with the real world; there must be something that we aim for---in aiming to be well-placed epistemic agents---whose realization is a factual matter." (23)

Granted they can agree upon a common practice, N and F owe us an account of such a practice, but the constraints imposed on them in so doing are radically different. N must provide an account of the practice without making any use of the contested constituents. [Isn't this in contradiction with his idea of a return to metaphysical innocence or who knows what?]

"The factualist's account must in this sense be representational: it must link up the practice with the underlying facts or subject-matter, while the antifactualist's account will be nonrepresentational." : in the case of the antifactualist, "the facts themselves should be understood in terms of how they are "projected" by the practice." (24)

(Note the underlined passage on p. 24: this suggessts that categoricity arguments can only be used by the realist if he acknowledges some mysterious way in which we got the right axioms!)

"The question of whether or not to be a factualist is therefore the question of whether or not to adopt a representational account of what grounds our practice." (24)

What is at issue, then? "[I]n providing an account of a given practice, we must come up with what is in effect a complete epistemology, philosophical psychology, and theory of language for the area in question; and in assessing such an account, we must in effect solve all major philosophical problems to which the area gives rise."

8. Reality as Fundamental

?!!!!

(See esp. p. 26)

Idea: take reality for granted and define reduction in terms of it. 

9. Settling What is Fundamental

"The mere fact that a proposition is basic will give us reason to believe that it is real, in the absence of any reason to the contrary." (27) More plausibly: real is basic factual. The rest of the section is a little weird. He argues that one should assume that any given grounded proposition is unreal, in the absence of any reason to the contrary. He jumps from that to the claim that one should be a "minimalist" in the sense that any "moot" proposition should be taken to be unreal.

@incollection{rosen1994,
	Address = {Dodrecht},
	Annote = {Minimal realism is just cognitivism plus the denial of error theory. Rosen takes this to be a legitimate charcterization. Is MR the only realism we understand? For one, one can say that rejecting MR makes the debate over modern idealism totally pointless. But if minimal realism is all there is to the question of realism, then it would be a mistake to deny anyone the right to the rich imagery. [I am a little confused at this point.]

The sense that seems to make MR not enough is that there is an issue that concerns not the existence of the objects and so on described by the discourse, but rather "what we have called their objectivity". Is there a line between the objective and the non-objective? [Further question: what makes objectivity something to strive for?]

III. Some senses of objectivity

Different senses of `objectivity'. 

1. Methodological objectivity. (As in lack of bias, or something like that.) "An objective view would then be one which any purely rational inquirer who turned his attention to the matter would eventually hold.'' [p. 283] Rosen claims that this is an entirely different issue from the one that concerns us here. [He says it is a debate over minimal realism, though I can't see why...]

2. `Non-inner objectivity': perhaps there are `private objects' to which no one but ourselves have access to. But this would not make them less than fully objective. [Is this right?]

IV. Mind-dependence:

``The objectivity that interests us is thus definitely to be contrasted with a sort of mind-dependence---or, to use a more modern idiom, a dependence on linguistic and social `practices'.'' (p. 287) But how to understand the notion of mind-dependence? 

One could try for "causally dependent on the mind". But this is no good. Frescoes are mind-dependent (say), but no one would deny that facts about Frescoes, or frescoes themselves, are less than fully objective. The same holds (says Rosen) for  other ways of understanding that notion, like "existential dependence". Dependence, therefore, must not be "empirical" [not really sure what that means], nor transcendental. So what is it? 

V. Response-dependence: 

Rosen gives a summary of Johnston's account of response-dependent concepts, and gives examples (with colors, causation, value, etc.). He worries that the primary/secondary quality distinction is correctly drawn in these terms. For one, the response dependent/independent distinction is an apriori matter, whereas the primary/secondary isn't meant to be. But in another sense, this seems like a promising candidate (Pettit puts it as follows: response-dependent concepts implicate a subject.)

But of course, response dependence tout court is not enough. THink of response-dependence for dogs. Would any such concept (being annoying to fox terriers, say) be less than full objective? Perhaps if we restrict RD for the essentially first-personal ones. "The thought is no doubt encouraged by the fact that when we employ such concepts there is now a definite sense in which our topic is  the world as it is for us. This has a Kantian ring." So, question: is there any reason to think that the facts about which things are valuable (say) in Lewis's sense are less than fully real or objective? One argument (p. 294-5) starts from "a species of metaphysical relativism"  to the rejection of realism. (Disagreement, truth for each of the parties, so no truth simpliciter.) This is tempting but, Rosen dixit, "it is really a gross confusion". For; why is there disagreement? "Judgments of the form Fa disagree when thy attribute incompatible properties to a single object." But when indexicals are present, we cannot jump from "syntactical disagreement" to disagreement tout court. 

[Is Rosen taking the disagreement seriously enough?]

VI. Objectivity as Judgment Independence

The problem with the RD approach is that RD concepts are just anthropological, and they implicate some subjects. But they can also be looked at "from the outside", thus becoming "fully objective". But perhaps JD, in Wright's sense, could do better. "When two things are genuinely independent, after all, it is always an empirical matter which conditions favor their co-occurrence. So if the F-facts are out there independently of us, we should have no insight a prioi into when certain psychological events ---our judgments that x is F--- should co-occur with the distinct facts about which things are F." [p. 299]

The idea is that RD about a given domain D makes facts about D somehow "constituted or at least constrained by our practices for fixing an opinion". Thus, we are inclined to view those positions as `antirealist'. [299] But this, says Rosen, is just an illusion of progress. As an example, he gives the concept of constitutionality at time (t). But his description strikes me as implausible. Why think that it is "a fact of modal sociology" what a given group of individuals would do if asked whether they approve of a certain law? This seems implausible to me, for it would seem to assume some degree of determinism. [Is this right?]

One possibility would be to make the distinction between first-personal and other JD concepts. This would be tempting given that we may sometimes think that there is some sort of immunity to error we we think whether certain conditions hold (suppose). For the anthropologist it is a substantive empirical question whether we are in fact in such and such conditions, but not to the person engaged in the inquiry. As an example, imagine a supreme court justice deciding whether a law is constitutional: "if he knows the analysis he knows that whatever he says will be right, provided only that he is thoughtful and clear-headed." [p. 303-4].  

[The discussion on pp. 304-5 is very interesting. One thought that appears is that it may be that the thought that one is aiming at an independent reality may stand to theoretical reason as the thought that one is free stands to practical reason. This seems an interesting point to explore. Another thought is that, regardless of any of this, what matters is that these things can be described from the anthropological perspective, and thus are fully objective if he think that the subject matter of the anthropologist's inquiry is fully objective. This argument deserves to be looked at more carefully. But what I find even more interesting is the claim that, since in some of the a priori provisional equations normative terms occur essentially, it may be that an "anti-realist" stance w.r.t. normativity may undermine the claim to objectivity of the subject matter in question.]

VII. Objectivity and the Absolute Conception of the world

Perhaps "the real is potentially accessible from indefinitely many distinct perspectives. It is there for everyone, regardless of his peculiar angle on the world." [Q: what is the domain of quantification here? Wouldn't this disqualify every discourse?] Another problem is that this seems to require a move from "thought" to "fact" that is somewhat suspicious, After all, for any tribe T that has a concept C, we may think that "the feature that T  actually call "C"" picks out the same property "out there". One could object that there is something about this that's a little fishy, for we may have failed to know what language the T use. But this seems, to me, to be irrelevant. 

Another way of cashing out what "the absolute conception of the world" is supposed to be is to proceed by abstraction, trying to reflect on the parochial character of out concepts and doing our best to see how these connect with what is out there in the world. A way of fleshing this out is (16) in Rosen's paper: 

A fact (property) is objective iff it must be mentioned (attributed to an object) in the best causal/explanatory account of the plurality of representations of the world. 

The idea is that primary qualities will come up in those explanations, whereas secondary qualities won't. As Rosen observes, considerations similar to these have been put to use in debates over the legitimacy of minimal realism. But  Williams doesn't think of them this way. The idea is tht what fails the test in (16) may well be a fact, but it is not an objective fact. How are we to take this criteron? Are we prepared (says Rosen) to deny that facts about stars are objective just because we can reduce them to facts about microphysical particles? [311] 

"There may well be an interesting contrast between the ultimate explanatory basis --- the smalles set of properties in terms of which the phenomena can be explained --- and the superstructure of supervening or constituting properties." [311] I think this is what must be looked at. "But on the face of it this distinction is at right angles to the purported contrast between the objective and the rest that is at stake in the debates over realism."

Wright offered a variation of this suggestion in terms of the notion of a "wide cosmological role". Rosen offers some sketchy response to it, but I find it a little unsatisfactory. The idea is to proceed by examples. [see p. 312-313]},

The paper is an examination of the notion of carving. Different sentences can be seen as, in a way, carving the same content. The neo-frefean usese this to argue that number talk is not objectionable, since it's just a recarving of a content we accept on independent grounds. Steve argues that one can say something stronger, viz. that such sentences do better at carving out the contents. The notion of S being a better carving of content C is explained in terms of how much better justice S does to Cs implicit structure and implication relations. The latter is something like this: S makes more transparent Cs entailments, in that S logically (and not just analytically) entails a sentence which expresses what's entailed by C. The former is somewhat obscure, but the thought is that the two are just the two sides of the same coing. (It requires talk of natural contents, etc.)},

Biological species are reproducing isolated from each other, which protects the integrity of their genotypes. Degree of morphological difference is not an appropriate species definition. Unequal rates of evolution of different characters and lack of information on the mating potential of isolated populations are the major difficulties in the demarcation of species taxa.},

@article{joyce1998,
	Abstract = {The pragmatic character of the Dutch book argument makes it unsuitable as an "epistemic" justification for the fundamental probabilist dogma that rational partial beliefs must conform to the axioms of probability. To secure an appropriately epistemic justification for this conclusion, one must explain what it means for a system of partial beliefs to accurately represent the state of the world, and then show that partial beliefs that violate the laws of probability are invariably less accurate than they could be otherwise. The first task can be accomplished once we realize that the accuracy of systems of partial beliefs can be measured on a gradational scale that satisfies a small set of formal constraints, each of which has a sound epistemic motivation. When accuracy is measured in this way it can be shown that any system of degrees of belief that violates the axioms of probability can be replaced by an alternative system that obeys the axioms and yet is more accurate in every possible world. Since epistemically rational agents must strive to hold accurate beliefs, this establishes conformity with the axioms of probability as a norm of epistemic rationality whatever its prudential merits or defects might be.},

	Abstract = {One recent trend in the philosophy of mathematics has been to approach the central epistemological and metaphysical issues concerning mathematics from the perspective of the applications of mathematics to describing the world, especially within the context of empirical science. A second area of activity is where philosophy of mathematics intersects with foundational issues in mathematics, including debates over the choice of set2013theoretic axioms, and over whether category theory, for example, may provide an alternative foundation for mathematics. My central claim is that these latter issues are of direct relevance to philosophical arguments connected to the applicability of mathematics. In particular, the possibility of there being distinct alternative foundations for mathematics blocks the standard argument from the indispensable role of mathematics in science to the existence of specific mathematical objects.},

	Abstract = {Conflicting accounts of the role of mathematics in our physical theories can be traced to two principles. Mathematics appears to be both (1) theoretically indispensable, as we have no acceptable non-mathematical versions of our theories, and (2) metaphysically dispensable, as mathematical entities, if they existed, would lack a relevant causal role in the physical world. I offer a new account of a role for mathematics in the physical sciences that emphasizes the epistemic benefits of having mathematics around when we do science. This account successfully reconciles theoretical indispensability and metaphysical dispensability and has important consequences for both advocates and critics of indispensability arguments for platonism about mathematics.},
